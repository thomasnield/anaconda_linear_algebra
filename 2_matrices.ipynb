    "A matrix is a grid of numbers that can represent data and a linear transformation. In machine learning and data science, you will find yourself using matrices a lot. Typically when you ingest data, you will often have to represent it in an numeric matrix. This even applies to non-numeric data like text, which is turned into numeric vectors and matrices so machine learning applications (like GPT) can mathematically operate on it. \n",
